        <div class="post-content">
            <p><strong>IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows</strong> is a fundamental international accounting standard that
                requires entities to present information about the historical changes in their cash and cash
                equivalents. This statement is crucial for users of financial statements to assess the liquidity,
                solvency, and financial adaptability of a business.</p>

            <h2>1. Definition</h2>
            <p>The primary objective of IAS 7 is to provide information about the historical movements in cash and cash
                equivalents. To do this, it defines two key concepts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cash:</strong> Comprises cash on hand and demand deposits.</li>
                <li><strong>Cash Equivalents:</strong> Short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily
                    convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in
                    value (usually maturing within three months or less).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Recognition (Classification of Activities)</h2>
            <p>IAS 7 requires that cash flows be classified into three distinct categories:</p>

            <h3>a. Operating Activities</h3>
            <p>These are the principal revenue-producing activities of the entity. They primarily result from the
                transactions and events that enter into the determination of profit or loss.</p>
            <p><em>Examples:</em> Cash receipts from the sale of goods/services, cash payments to suppliers and
                employees, cash payments or refunds of income taxes.</p>

            <h3>b. Investing Activities</h3>
            <p>These activities involve the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not
                included in cash equivalents. They represent the extent to which expenditures have been made for
                resources intended to generate future income and cash flows.</p>
            <p><em>Examples:</em> Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment (PPE), cash receipts from
                sales of PPE, cash advances and loans made to other parties.</p>

            <h3>c. Financing Activities</h3>
            <p>These are activities that result in changes in the size and composition of the contributed equity and
                borrowings of the entity.</p>
            <p><em>Examples:</em> Cash proceeds from issuing shares, cash payments to owners to acquire or redeem the
                entity’s shares, cash proceeds from issuing loans/debentures, cash repayments of amounts borrowed.</p>

            <h2>3. Measurement and Reporting</h2>
            <p>IAS 7 allows for two methods of reporting cash flows from <strong>operating activities</strong>:</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Direct Method (Encouraged):</strong> Discloses major classes of gross cash receipts and
                        gross cash payments. This method provides information which may be useful in estimating future
                        cash flows and which is not available under the indirect method.</li>
                    <li><strong>Indirect Method (Most Common):</strong> Adjusts profit or loss for the effects of
                        transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash
                        receipts or payments, and items of income or expense associated with investing or financing cash
                        flows.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>Cash flows from <strong>investing</strong> and <strong>financing</strong> activities are generally
                reported on a gross basis (i.e., gross receipts and gross payments are listed separately), although net
                reporting is allowed in specific limited circumstances.</p>

            <h2>4. Practical Real-Life Example</h2>
            <p>Let's consider a practical scenario for a fictional company, "Bammy Tech Ltd," for the year ended 31
                December 2024.</p>

            <h3>Scenario Data:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Net Profit before tax: $100,000</li>
                <li>Depreciation charge: $20,000</li>
                <li>Increase in Receivables: $5,000</li>
                <li>Decrease in Payables: $2,000</li>
                <li>Purchase of new server equipment: $50,000</li>
                <li>Proceeds from bank loan: $30,000</li>
                <li>Dividends paid: $10,000</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Statement of Cash Flows (Indirect Method Approach)</h3>

            <div class="code-block">
                <p><strong>Cash Flows from Operating Activities:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Profit before tax: $100,000</li>
                    <li><em>Adjustments for:</em> Depreciation: +$20,000</li>
                    <li><em>Working Capital Changes:</em></li>
                    <li>Increase in Receivables (Cash trapped in sales): ($5,000)</li>
                    <li>Decrease in Payables (Cash paid out): ($2,000)</li>
                    <li><strong>Net Cash from Operating Activities: $113,000</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Cash Flows from Investing Activities:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Purchase of server equipment: ($50,000)</li>
                    <li><strong>Net Cash used in Investing Activities: ($50,000)</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Cash Flows from Financing Activities:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Proceeds from bank loan: +$30,000</li>
                    <li>Dividends paid: ($10,000)</li>
                    <li><strong>Net Cash from Financing Activities: $20,000</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents: $83,000</strong><br>
                    <em>($113,000 - $50,000 + $20,000)</em>
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> While a company might show a healthy profit (like the $100,000 above),
                    the cash flow statement reveals the actual liquidity available. In this case, the company generated
                    strong cash from operations and used it to invest in new equipment while also raising some debt
                    financing.</p>
